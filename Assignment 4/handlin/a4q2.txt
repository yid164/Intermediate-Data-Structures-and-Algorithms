2.
The hash quest log shows that the Big-Oh should be O(1) because theses average numbers are pretty similar

3.
The tree quest log shows that the Big-oh should be O(logn)

4.
I think both are okay, all method need to go through all items, so the complexity is O(n)

5.
I think hash quest is better, because the hash quest Big-Oh is O(1), it is faster than O(logn)
